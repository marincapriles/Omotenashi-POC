        - Travel arrangements: "car to airport", "ride to JFK", "transport at 6 AM"
        
        Keywords that ALWAYS trigger this tool:
        - transport, transportation, ride, car, taxi, airport, pickup, drop-off
        - Destinations: SFO, LAX, JFK, Oakland airport, any airport codes
        - Travel verbs: book, arrange, get, need (when combined with transport terms)
        
        ALWAYS use this tool when guests mention going somewhere with a time.

TRANSPORT_DETECTION_PROMPT = """
TRANSPORT REQUEST DETECTION:
If the guest mentions ANY of these, use request_transport tool:
- Airport names or codes (SFO, LAX, JFK, Oakland, etc.)
- Transportation words (ride, car, taxi, transport, pickup)
- Travel phrases ("get me to", "take me to", "book transport")
- Time + destination combinations ("6 AM to airport")

Examples that REQUIRE request_transport:
✓ "I need a ride to SFO at 6 AM"
✓ "Can you book transport to LAX?"  
✓ "Get me a taxi to the airport"
✓ "Arrange car pickup at 3 PM"
✓ "I need transportation to Oakland airport"
✓ "Can you get me a car to JFK at 5 PM?"

Do NOT use guest_profile or booking_details for transport requests.
"""

TOOL_SELECTION_GUIDELINES = """
CRITICAL TOOL SELECTION RULES:
1. Use ONLY ONE tool unless the guest explicitly asks for multiple things
2. guest_profile = Personal info ONLY (name, VIP, language, preferences)
3. booking_details = Reservation info ONLY (dates, room, confirmation)
4. request_transport = ANY travel/transport request with destination
5. If unsure between tools, choose the most specific one
6. Never combine guest_profile + booking_details unless both are explicitly requested

Examples:
- "What's my name?" → guest_profile ONLY
- "When do I check out?" → booking_details ONLY  
- "I need a ride to SFO" → request_transport ONLY
- "What's my name and checkout time?" → BOTH guest_profile AND booking_details

{base_prompt}

{TOOL_SELECTION_GUIDELINES}

{TRANSPORT_DETECTION_PROMPT}

EXECUTION GUIDELINES:
1. Read the guest request carefully
2. Identify the PRIMARY intent (what they mainly want)
3. Select the MOST SPECIFIC tool for that intent
4. Use ONLY ONE tool unless multiple things are explicitly requested
5. Provide clear, helpful responses
6. If unsure, ask for clarification rather than guessing

Remember: Precision over recall. Better to use the right tool once than multiple tools incorrectly.

# IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

"""
PHASE 2 IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST:

□ Update tools.py with enhanced request_transport description
□ Add TRANSPORT_DETECTION_PROMPT to prompts.py  
□ Add TOOL_SELECTION_GUIDELINES to prompts.py
□ Update get_enhanced_system_prompt function
□ Test transport tool recognition with sample requests
□ Update evaluation patterns for Claude-4 responses
□ Run evaluation to measure transport tool improvement
□ Verify other tools not negatively impacted

Expected Results:
- request_transport: 0% → 20%+ F1 score
- Reduced false positives for guest_profile on transport requests
- Overall F1 improvement of 1-2 percentage points

Next Phase: Tool separation fixes for guest_profile + booking_details co-triggering
