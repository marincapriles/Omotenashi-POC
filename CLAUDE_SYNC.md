# Claude Multi-Instance Synchronization Protocol

## Communication Strategy

### üìã Decision Capture Framework

All architectural and design decisions must be logged in this file using the following format:

```markdown
## [DECISION-ID] [TIMESTAMP] Decision Title
**Decided by**: Claude-Instance-X
**Impact**: High/Medium/Low
**Files Affected**: list of files
**Description**: What was decided and why
**Implementation**: How it was implemented
**Next Actions**: Required follow-up tasks for other instances
```

### üîÑ Sync Triggers

**Mandatory Sync Points**:
1. Before major architectural changes
2. After completing feature implementations  
3. Before production deployments
4. When encountering cross-file dependencies
5. Daily sync at session start

**Sync Commands**:
```bash
# Pull latest changes and sync context
git pull origin claude-migration
git merge claude-instance-2  # or appropriate branch
# Read CLAUDE_SYNC.md for latest decisions
```

### üìä Context Alignment Protocol

**Phase 1: Status Sync** (Every session start)
1. Read CLAUDE_SYNC.md for latest decisions
2. Check git log for recent commits from other instances
3. Review modified files for architectural changes
4. Update your working context

**Phase 2: Decision Communication** (Before major changes)
1. Log decision in CLAUDE_SYNC.md
2. Commit with clear [CLAUDE-X] prefix
3. Push to share with other instances
4. Tag urgent decisions with üö® URGENT prefix

**Phase 3: Implementation Coordination** (During development)
1. Update progress in CLAUDE_SYNC.md
2. Note any discovered dependencies
3. Flag required actions for other instances
4. Commit frequently with descriptive messages

### [DEC-007] 2025-12-22 Workplan Coordination Analysis Complete
**Decided by**: Concierge-san
**Impact**: High
**Files Affected**: CONCIERGE_RYOKAN_COORDINATION_ANALYSIS.md
**Description**: Identified 4 critical coordination conflicts between instance workplans
**Implementation**:
- Database migration dependency: Ryokan-chan JSON expansion vs Concierge-san DB migration
- Authentication system overlap: Both implementing simultaneously
- Monitoring analytics duplication: Technical vs business metrics split needed
- Infrastructure timing: UI work disruption during containerization
**Next Actions**:
- üö® URGENT-CONCIERGE-SAN: Create database schema design this session
- üö® URGENT-CONCIERGE-SAN: Design authentication API contract
- Ryokan-chan: Delay data expansion until DB schema approved
- Ryokan-chan: Coordinate authentication frontend with backend API

### üö® URGENT COORDINATION FLAGS
- **Database Schema**: Must be designed before Ryokan-chan data work (BLOCKING)
- **Authentication API**: Contract needed for frontend/backend coordination
- **Development Environment**: Docker setup must work for both instances
- **Data Migration**: Ryokan-chan waiting for DB migration before expanding data
