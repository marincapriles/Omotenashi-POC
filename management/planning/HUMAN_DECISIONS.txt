[HIGH PRIORITY - BLOCKING PILOT DEPLOYMENT]

DECISION-001: DEPLOYMENT PLATFORM
Question: Which cloud platform should we use for pilot deployment?
Options: 
- AWS (most mature, higher cost)
- Azure (good integration, mid cost) 
- GCP (competitive pricing, good AI tools)
- DigitalOcean (simple, cost-effective)
- Other (specify)

DECISION: 
I prefer GCP or other chaper alternative, but I don't have a strong preference

DECISION-002: PILOT TIMELINE  
Question: How many weeks until customer pilot launch?
Context: We need this to prioritize features vs. stability
Options:
- 2-3 weeks (minimal features, focus on core functionality)
- 4-6 weeks (balanced approach, current plan)
- 6-8 weeks (full feature set, maximum polish)

DECISION:
Let's give ourselves 8 weeks to create an effective realizatio of the concept. The most important pieces of the product is high qualtiy tool selection based on guest intent and successful execution of the workflows


DECISION-003: SPANISH LANGUAGE SUPPORT
Question: Should we deploy with current 66.7% Spanish success rate or wait for fixes?
Context: Ryokan-chan can fix Spanish gaps, but it takes time
Options:
- Deploy now with English/French only (faster to market)
- Wait for Spanish fixes (67% â†’ 85%+ success rate)
- Deploy with warning about Spanish limitations

DECISION:
prioritize spanish fixes. I want to prioritize Latin America and Spain as potential markets for pilot customers


DECISION-004: CONCURRENT USER CAPACITY
Question: How many concurrent guests should the system handle during pilot?
Context: Affects infrastructure sizing and costs
Options:
- 10-20 guests (small luxury property)
- 20-50 guests (medium property or multiple small)
- 50-100 guests (large property or multiple properties)

DECISION:
20 guests

- SMS + WhatsApp (for international guests)
- Add social login (Google, Apple)

DECISION:



DECISION-006: ERROR HANDLING AGGRESSIVENESS
Question: How should the system handle tool failures?
Context: Balance between reliability and user experience
Options:
- Conservative (fail fast, escalate to human)
- Moderate (retry once, then escalate)
- Aggressive (multiple retries, fallback tools)

DECISION:



DECISION-007: MONITORING DEPTH
Question: What level of monitoring do you want during pilot?
Context: More monitoring = better insights but higher complexity
Options:
- Basic (uptime, errors, response times)
- Standard (+ tool usage, guest satisfaction, performance)
- Comprehensive (+ business analytics, revenue tracking, prediction)

DECISION:



DECISION-008: DATA BACKUP FREQUENCY
Question: How often should we backup conversation and guest data?
Context: Balance between data safety and storage costs
Options:

- Hourly (good balance, recommended)
- Daily (lower cost, some risk)

DECISION:
