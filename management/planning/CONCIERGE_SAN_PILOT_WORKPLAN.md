### üö® **Critical Gaps for Customer Pilot (Concierge-san Scope)**

#### **P0 - DEPLOYMENT BLOCKERS**
1. **No Production Infrastructure**
   - Current: Development server only (`uvicorn` on port 8000)
   - Need: Production WSGI server, load balancing, scaling
   
2. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Current: API keys exposed in `.env` file
   - Current: CORS allows all origins (`allow_origins=["*"]`)
   - Need: Secrets management, proper CORS configuration

3. **No Monitoring/Observability**
   - Current: Basic logging only
   - Need: Performance metrics, error tracking, uptime monitoring

4. **Single Point of Failure**
   - Current: Single server instance
   - Need: High availability, failover mechanisms

#### **P1 - CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE CRITICAL**
5. **No Authentication/Authorization**
   - Current: Open access to all endpoints
   - Need: Guest authentication, rate limiting

6. **No Data Persistence Strategy**
   - Current: In-memory session storage
   - Need: Database for conversations, guest profiles

7. **No Customer Onboarding Flow**
   - Current: Manual guest selection from dropdown
   - Need: Guest registration, phone verification

8. **No Error Recovery Mechanisms**
   - Current: Basic error handling
   - Need: Graceful degradation, retry logic

#### **P2 - OPERATIONAL READINESS**
9. **No Backup/Recovery**
   - Current: No data backup strategy
   - Need: Data backup, disaster recovery

10. **No Deployment Automation**
    - Current: Manual deployment
    - Need: CI/CD pipeline, environment management
