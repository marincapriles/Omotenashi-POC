- **UI/UX Limitations**: Basic HTML interface, no guest management dashboard
- **Production Monitoring**: No error tracking, performance analytics, or guest satisfaction metrics
- **Real Integration Gaps**: Mock responses instead of actual service connections
- **Security & Auth**: No guest authentication or data protection measures
